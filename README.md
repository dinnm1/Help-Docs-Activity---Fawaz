Good help files/instructions:

1. http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Help-File
The above list of instructions are quite easy to understand, each step is assisted by a screenshot to provide the user with a visual representation. Every step has a title, all of which are clearly outlined by the use of bold characters.

2. http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Pancakes
Each step begins with a visual representation of how it's done, this list of instructions uses 2-5 second videos that automatically play when you get to a new step. The font used is clear and easy to read.

3. http://www.howtogeek.com/197559/how-to-install-windows-10-on-your-pc/
Once again we see the use of screenshots in these help file. It's being explained as if you were in a coversation with the person who made this help file. There are extra helpful tips in some steps that you may want to consider.

Bad help files/instructions:

1. http://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-take-screen-shots/?ALLSTEPS
The set of instructions above are beyond appalling. The author uses incorrect grammar and spelling countless times throughout the help file. Goes on and on about things we don't need to know.
